## 1. Overview

The main aim of this project is to use a privacy-preserving approach to automatically detect whether someone is indoors or outdoors using an OMRON 2JCIE-BL01 wearable sensor, employing machine learning techniques. This comprehensive effort involves collecting, analysing, and predicting sensor data to distinguish between indoor and outdoor environments. It combines a Python script for data collection via Bluetooth LE devices, Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing and analysis, a model training notebook, and a supportive dataset. This approach is particularly beneficial for sectors like healthcare, where it can aid in elderly care, monitoring dementia patients, mental health care, and child monitoring.
